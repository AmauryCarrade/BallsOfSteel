Generates a sphere (or anything defined in map.yml).

Takes a sphere name: the ones in the map.yml file (in the
spheres list, the "name" key), without spaces. If two
spheres share their names, the first one will be taken
(so avoid names duplicates).

Without other arguments, generates the sphere where the
player is, or fails if the sender is not a player. You
can also provide coordinates (they may be relative,
with ~), and world.

You can add "-s" after the arguments to set your WorldEdit
selection to the thing just created.

Relative coordinates cannot be used from the console,
and without world, the player world or the default Balls
of Steel world are used.
