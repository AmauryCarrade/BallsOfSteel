Removes all items on the ground, except the diamond ones.

This command was made to be able to clear the ground,
when for some reasons a lot of items are in the wild,
without removing precious fallen diamonds. It's
especially useful for easily-broken spheres, such as
snow ones.

All ground items will be cleared, except diamonds,
diamond blocks, diamond tools & weapons, diamond
armors and diamond ores.
