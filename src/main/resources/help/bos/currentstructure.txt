You can use the following (sub-)commands.

§6/bos currentstructure §7(no argument)
    Displays what the structure you are into, is.
§6/bos currentstructure select
    If WorldEdit is installed, sets your WorldEdit
    selection to the structure you are into.
§6/bos currentstructure forget
    Removes the structure you are into from the
    world metadata. Subsequent calls to §7/bos
    §7currentstructure§r will say that there is
    no structure here.
    This will not delete the structure.
