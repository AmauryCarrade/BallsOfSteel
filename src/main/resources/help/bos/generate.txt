Generates a world.

This command will create a new world using either
the world name defined in the configuration, or
the name given as argument, if specified.

The world will be fully pre-loaded. Please note
that the initial load may be very painful for
the server, and you may (in fact, will probably)
be disconnected due to server ping timeout.

Metadata about the world generation will be put
into the world folder, in the following file:
§7<world>/data/balls_of_steel/metadata.json§r.
